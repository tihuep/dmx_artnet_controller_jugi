Artnet DMX Controller for a youth group's venue specifically

___
This app uses the [artnet4j](https://github.com/cansik/artnet4j) library by fellow Swiss guy [@cansik](https://github.com/cansik) and for the color picker, the [ColorPickerPreference](https://github.com/skydoves/ColorPickerPreference) by [@skydoves](https://github.com/skydoves).

This Artnet DMX controller was created to control the rather simple lighting setup of the youth room of our church.
To fit our needs perfectly, the app is pretty limited and isn't dynamic in any way, to make using it as easy as possible.
